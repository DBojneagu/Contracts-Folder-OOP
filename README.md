# ProiectPOO_2
This is my second project of this semester on Object Oriented Programming. I implemented an console menu, from where you can add contracts, delete them, print them out, and calculate the total cost of the contracts.

We needed to implement the terms like : virtual functions, dynamic cast, try-catch, derived class etc.
